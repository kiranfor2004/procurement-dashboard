## üìù Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Open your web browser** and go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)

2. **Sign in** to your GitHub account (or create one if you don't have it)

3. **Click the "+" icon** in the top-right corner of the page

4. **Select "New repository"** from the dropdown menu

5. **Fill in repository details:**
   ```
   Repository name: procurement-dashboard
   Description: Interactive Procurement Analytics Dashboard with Advanced KPIs and Drill-down Reporting
   ```

6. **Choose visibility:**
   - ‚úÖ **Public** (recommended - allows GitHub Pages)
   - Or **Private** (if you prefer)

7. **Important:** 
   - ‚ùå **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
   - ‚ùå **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore"
   - ‚ùå **DO NOT** check "Choose a license"
   - (We already have these files)

8. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions.

1. **Copy the repository URL** - it will look like:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/procurement-dashboard.git
   ```

2. **Keep this URL handy** - you'll need it in the next step

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

1. **Open PowerShell** in your project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\kiran\procurement-dashboard"
   ```

2. **Add GitHub as remote origin** (replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual GitHub username):
   ```powershell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/procurement-dashboard.git
   ```

3. **Verify the remote was added:**
   ```powershell
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   origin  https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/procurement-dashboard.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/procurement-dashboard.git (push)
   ```

### Step 4: Push Files to GitHub

1. **Push your files to GitHub:**
   ```powershell
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Enter credentials if prompted:**
   - Username: Your GitHub username
   - Password: Your GitHub personal access token (not your account password)

   > **Note:** If you don't have a personal access token:
   > - Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   > - Generate new token with "repo" permissions

3. **Wait for upload to complete** - you'll see output like:
   ```
   Enumerating objects: 16, done.
   Counting objects: 100% (16/16), done.
   Delta compression using up to 8 threads
   Compressing objects: 100% (15/15), done.
   Writing objects: 100% (16/16), 45.67 MiB | 2.34 MiB/s, done.
   Total 16 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
   To https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/procurement-dashboard.git
   * [new branch]      master -> master
   Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
   ```

### Step 5: Verify Upload on GitHub

1. **Refresh your GitHub repository page**

2. **You should see all your files:**
   - ‚úÖ app.py
   - ‚úÖ dashboard.html
   - ‚úÖ Purchase data.csv
   - ‚úÖ README.md
   - ‚úÖ requirements.txt
   - ‚úÖ And all other documentation files

### Step 6: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional - for web access)

1. **In your GitHub repository, click "Settings" tab**

2. **Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar**

3. **Under "Source":**
   - Select: **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Branch: **"master"** (or "main")
   - Folder: **"/ (root)"**

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **GitHub will provide a URL** like:
   ```
   https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/procurement-dashboard/
   ```

6. **Access your dashboard at:**
   ```
   https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/procurement-dashboard/dashboard.html
   ```
